#### Comments about build

Fantastic Box Co form was built as an AngularJS single page application as I felt the dynamic natural of angularjs would give the best user experience. And also allow me to update the form with angulars two way data binding.

This project was test driven using Karma for unit testing and then Protractor for feature testing.

I saved the product data as a local JSON file and called it through an Angular factory as I wanted to generate the HTML dynamically and it allows the option of moving it to an external API if required.
